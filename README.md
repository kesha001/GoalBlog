# GoalBlog

This project is based on [The New and Improved Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
The goal of the project was to learn modern web development with python, particulary with flask.
Flask is known for its felxibility and one should choose and implement all parts functionality on their own.
Therefore I believe that this could help me understand parts of building web applications.
Firstly I read og followed all steps in the book. Then I did the project on my own without following steps in the book, but using similar technologies and implementing similar functionality.
I believe this can help understand better why specific steps in the book are implemented the way they are and develop troubleshooting and problemsolving skills because you meed some difficulties when you do the project on your own that you do not meet when following the book.

In addition I want to extend the project to more functionality such as change posts to Goals where people share their goals and mark when they are done, and create some kind of dashboard on users page.
